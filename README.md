# Automated Data Pipeline for Autonomous Vehicle Logs
Built an automated data pipeline to process, analyze, and store large-scale sensor and event log data from autonomous vehicles. The system enables real-time insights and supports machine learning applications for predictive analytics and system diagnostics.

# Automated Data Pipeline for Autonomous Vehicle Logs

## Overview
The **Automated Data Pipeline for Autonomous Vehicle Logs** is a Python-based solution designed to efficiently process, analyze, and store sensor and event log data generated by autonomous vehicles. This system utilizes various big data technologies, including Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, Apache Spark for distributed data processing, and AWS services for scalable storage. The pipeline processes raw sensor data (e.g., GPS, LiDAR, radar, and camera feeds), performs real-time analytics, and generates insights for vehicle diagnostics and performance monitoring.

The project aims to automate the end-to-end process of data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, real-time analytics, and storage, with a focus on scalability, efficiency, and ease of integration with machine learning workflows.

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data collection from autonomous vehicles using Apache Kafka.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Distributed data processing with Apache Spark to clean and synchronize raw sensor logs.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derives key features like speed, proximity to obstacles, and braking events.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Performs real-time analytics on vehicle performance, detects anomalies, and generates diagnostics reports.
- **Data Storage**: Stores processed data in AWS S3 with optimized partitioning for efficient querying.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes real-time vehicle performance metrics and anomaly trends.
- **Automation**: Automates the pipeline using AWS Lambda for continuous data processing.
